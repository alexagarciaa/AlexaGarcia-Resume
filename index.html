        <p class="lead mb-4">Dear reader, 
My name is Alexa Garcia and I am currently a member of the undergraduate program at the University of California-Riverside. I am a second year student working towards a Bachelor degree in Sociology. I originally enrolled as a biology major, hoping to go into a nursing route in the future. I quickly realized that I didn't have a passion for medicine and biology so I switched over to sociology, knowing that I would be happiest working towards a career in criminology. 
<br><br>

        So far, my work experience has been limited, but extremely rewarding as it has given me skills to continue using in the future. I got my first job at the age of sixteen. I started working as an office assistant for my fathers company, Advanced Painting and Rick's Rain Gutters. I specifically worked for the Gutters side of the company. At first my job consisted of running errands and getting busy work done for the secretaries. Thankfully, as I grew with the company, I was able to develop more responsibilities. Soon enough, I was given my own office space and I had my own list of tasks to complete for the company. Through this job, I gained confidence when dealing with customers. I learned to make phone calls and schedule estimate proposals through email. I learned how to keep some company records and keep a clean, organized office space. By the time I was 18, I unfortunately had to say goodbye to the company and the position as I started my journey through college. 
<br><br>

        My next job was with a shoe reseller company named Kore at the local mall. This was my first job in retail, so it was a bit nerve wracking at first but I was confident that my prior job experience would help guide me through. When taking up the job, I knew nothing about shoes, much less how to convince people to buy shoes in person. Thankfully, with the help of some coworkers and my managers, I quickly picked up some tricks of the trade and became one of the top salespeople on the team. This job was especially challenging to manage as I learned to balance student life and work. Oftentimes, work would conflict with my school class schedule. This would create complications at work as the company was very strict about not switching around set schedules. I have since improved my communication skills with the company and managers to create a schedule that works for everyone, without inconveniencing anyone. Unfortunately, I have to go back home for the summer so I wont be able to keep this job up in Riverside as it would be much too far of a commute. Thankfully, I kept communicating with Advanced Painting and Rick's Rain Gutters so I will be able to reclaim my position for the summer and continue to improve and gain experience.
